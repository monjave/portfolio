<BaseLayout title="About">
  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a programmer with experience in C++ and Qt, as well as Python and Java, and a strong interest
    in building software that interacts with real systems. My background includes projects that
    combine application development with hardware integration, serial communication, and testing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in work that emphasizes understanding how systems behave in practice.
    I enjoy projects where I can dig into how components interact, reason about failures, and design
    solutions that are both reliable and maintainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently focused on continuing to build my skills through hands-on projects and collaborative
    work, with the goal of contributing to teams that value thoughtful engineering and well-designed
    systems.
