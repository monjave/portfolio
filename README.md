# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the **source code for my personal portfolio website**. The site is designed primarily for **recruiters, hiring managers, and other engineers** who want to understand who I am as an engineer and programmer.

While the website itself is not the main project, it serves as **infrastructure that supports and showcases my real work**, particularly in **embedded systems and hardware–software integration**. Think of it as the frame around the projects, not the centerpiece.

The live site includes a footer link to this repository (`View site source`) for anyone interested in how it was built.

## Goals

* Present my work in a clear, accessible way
* Highlight engineering projects rather than flashy web effects
* Demonstrate that I am a **well-rounded engineer**, even though my primary interests are embedded and hardware-focused
* Maintain full control over my content and deployment pipeline

---

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Astro
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Styling:** Plain CSS (no UI framework)

This stack was chosen to keep the site fast, simple, and maintainable without unnecessary complexity.

## Why Astro?

I am not a web developer by trade, so I intentionally chose a framework that:

* Supports **static site generation**
* Is easy to learn and reason about
* Avoids heavy client-side JavaScript
* Produces fast, minimal output

Astro lets me build a clean, modern site without pulling focus away from the type of engineering I actually want to do.

## Key Features

* Static site for performance and simplicity
* Project-focused layout
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile
* Embedded media (images, PDFs, external links)
* Custom GitHub Actions pipeline for automated deployment to GitHub Pages

---

## Highlighted Projects

Currently featured projects include:

* **Sickest Car Dash** – A real-time automotive telemetry dashboard
* **Heart-Shaped LED Turn Signals** – An Arduino-based embedded hardware prototype

As I complete more work (including ongoing capstone projects), additional projects will be added. The site also links directly to my GitHub profile for anyone who wants to explore more code.

---

## Project Status

This site is a **living document**.

* Content will grow as new projects are completed
* Visual style may evolve over time
* Structure may change as my interests and career develop

The goal is not perfection, but accurate representation.

---

## Tone & Design Philosophy

The site aims to be:

* Professional, but personal
* Clean and readable
* Honest about what I know and what I am still learning

It is meant to reflect me as an engineer, not as a brand.
